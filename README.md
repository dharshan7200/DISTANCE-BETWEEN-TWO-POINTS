# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1:
Importing math module in program
### Step 2:
Assigning 2 list for matrix calculation
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4:
Print the statements.
### Step 5:
End the program.
### PROGRAM:
```

import math
l1=[4,2]
l2=[10,6]
distance=math.sqrt(((l2[0]-l1[0])**2)+((l2[1]-l1[1])**2))
print("{:.2f}".format(distance))
```
### OUTPUT:

![distance](https://github.com/dharshan7200/DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS/assets/138850116/df3574ed-ae05-4c39-824c-2bc7670c71f6)

### RESULT:
Thus the DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS is executed successfully.
